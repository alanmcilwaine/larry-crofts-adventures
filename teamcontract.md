/**
 * Team's Goals:
 * - Get things done at least 5 days before due date
 * - Use issue boards for problems
 * - Organise code structure and interactions (Very very important!)
 * - Plan of what we will be doing
 * - Aim to integrate early and slighly more frequently to make sure our code is working together
 * 
 * Norms:
 * - Meeting Lead to go through section (John)
 * - Documenting Meetings and Summary (David)
 * - +/- 3 hours of meetings per week
 * - 5 hrs a week of work
 * 
 * How We Will Work:
 * - Before we code something we must add an issue first (code to an issue)
 * - Manage issue board well
 * - Using Git branches, merging, pulling, pushing etc
 * - Ask for approval for merge requests
 * - Git branch style ---- [package name] / [issue number] [new feature added]
 * - If there is a bug in someone elses code during testing we will assign it to that person to fix instead of touching it ourselves
 * 
 * How We Will Communicate:
 * - Everyone makes both meetings every week
 * - Missed meetings = Plan another time for team talk
 * - Meeting Summary
 * - Communication between people who are working on packages
 * - DM Person about the problems with code
 * - Communicate if deadlines cannot be met (Assistence to help complete)
 * 
 * When We Will Meet:
 * - One in-person meeting and one online meeting per week
 * - Online 1 - 2 pm Wednesday
 * - In Person (Undefined)
 * 
 * How We Will Solve Problems When They Arise:
 * - Tie breaker for votes (Carla)
 * - Merge conflicts (Affected members jump on voice call to resolve problem [Ask Alan and Li for technical problems])
 * - Waiting for another part of code for testing (DM and ask to help)
 * - Coding Problem, doesnt know how to code a specific part (Help channel in discord [create thread], supply code)
 * 
 * Rewards:
 * - Integration Day Completion Party
